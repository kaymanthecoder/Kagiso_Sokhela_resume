                    I am an inspiring software engineer. 
                    Always finding new ways to improve my programming skills. 
                    And strive to be a great asset to any team or company.<br><br>

                    It is important to ask for help when we need it, 
                    we can learn something new from each other which can add more ideas and functionality to our projects. 
                    Teamwork can create bonds between partners and employees. But it does depend on the task. 
                    When it comes to brainstorming, it is better to work in a team because multiple inputs can gather great ideas 
                    and highlight people's strengths and weaknesses. But I do enjoy working alone as well, 
                    I believe it is good to be independent sometimes which can provide the space for quiet concentration and productivity. 
                    I can easily adapt in any envorinment and produce a product either alone or in a team.<br><br>

                    I have learnt a good number of programming languages so far. I still learn something new from them every week since technology is always improving 
                    and I need to keep up-to-date with the latest updates. I do not want to limited myself with just the programming languages 
                    I have learnt thus far, so i am currently learning new ones as well. You can check out which programming languages 
                    I have learnt and currently learning by checking on the 'Skills' button above.<br><br>

                    I work on projects almost everyday. Some are small projects which I completed in less than a couple of hours. 
                    And some are big projects which I have completed and currently working on which took a couple of days or weeks. 
                    I am picky with which projects I choose to upload onto my github. You can see my github projects by using the 'Projects' 
                    link above, opening one of my projects and clicking on the heading of the project or clicking on the github icon that is next to it.
                    When you use the 'Project' link you'll find pictures of my projects and a description of how they work as well.
                    You also have the option to visit my github by clicking on the github icon in the 'Contact' tab. 
                    The projects you see on my githubs are not the only projects I have created. 
                    There are a lot more projects I have made and I would be more than happy to talk about them and present them.<br><br>

                    Feel free to contact me. You can see my details on the 'Contact' link above. I will be really happy if you reach out to me, whether it is for a job opportunity, 
                    collaboration or some constructive criticism. I like recieving feedback which can help me make positive improvements on my projects, website or for future problems.
